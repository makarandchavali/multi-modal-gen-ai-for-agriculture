# 🌾 Multimodal AI System for Agricultural Disease Detection and Chatbot Support

This project focuses on improving crop health and assisting farmers through a powerful AI system that:
1. Detects plant diseases using image data.
2. Understands user queries using language models.
3. Offers chatbot support through an interactive interface.

---

## 🔍 What Does It Do?

- ✅ Detects plant diseases from uploaded images using a CNN model.
- ✅ Uses CLIP (image + text) to enhance detection accuracy.
- ✅ Provides chatbot responses based on user queries about farming.
- ✅ Combines all features into one final system.
- ✅ Built with a working frontend and backend for user interaction.
